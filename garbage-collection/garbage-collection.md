## Garbage Collection
> Base notes about gc implementation

`garbage collection` was one of the main features of high level programming languages in their earlier days. Programmer could stop worring about management of memory and all implicit memory leaks that are hard to detect, compiler can do memory management for you.

There are lots of different gc algorithms but the most common one is `mark-sweep`.

As it can be understandable from the name this algorithm involve two stages of processing: marking and sweeping

#### Stage 1: Marking

TBD

#### Stage 2: Sweep
